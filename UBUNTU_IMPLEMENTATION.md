```bash
cd wifi-vulnerability-scanner
./validate-ubuntu.sh          # Quick health check
```

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing
```bash
./setup.sh                    # Automated dependency installation
./test-ubuntu.sh              # Full test suite (20+ tests)
```

### Phase 3: Functionality Demonstration
```bash
npm run ubuntu-demo           # Ubuntu-specific features
npm run demo                  # Full interactive demo
npm run quick-demo            # Educational content demo
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing
```bash
./bin/wifi-scanner-linux.sh   # Native Linux launcher
npm run platform-test         # Platform detection validation
DEBUG=* npm run demo          # Debug mode testing
```
