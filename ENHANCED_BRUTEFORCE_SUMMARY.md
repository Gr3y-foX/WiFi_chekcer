// Enhanced assessment
const assessment = bruteForceProtection.enhancedPasswordStrengthAssessment(
    'NetworkName',
    { encryption: 'WPA2' },
    { vendor: 'Netgear' }
);

// Dictionary attack simulation
const dictResults = bruteForceProtection.simulateDictionaryAttack(
    'WiFiNetwork',
    { encryption: 'WPA2' },
    { vendor: 'Linksys' }
);

// Generate 16-character passwords
const hybridPasswords = bruteForceProtection.generateHybridPasswords(
    'HomeNet',
    { encryption: 'WPA2' },
    { vendor: 'ASUS' }
);
```
